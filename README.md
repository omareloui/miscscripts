# Misc Scripts

A collection of maximum one files scripts.

## `group-ranges`

A Script to create ranges of UTF8 codepoints of nerdfonts icons. It was made
to be able to configure kitty's `symbol_map` to use the nerdfonts symbols font.

## How to use

Go to <https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet> and run the script in the console
_after_ loading all the icons (write " " in the search bar and keep on
scrolling).

## Notes

- The `packages.json` is only for LSP to run tsserver, it's not used for any
  other reason.
